Learning Python with the 'Python Basics' Treehouse Course


## Notes
_"Everything's an object"_

**Some Rules for Writing Python**
- blocks are indented 4 spaces
- blocks start with a colon
- variables and functions should be lowercase and use underscores
- no use for semicolons at the end of lines
- Python variables don't have sitchels, or symbols at the beginning of them

```Python
def answer_the_phone():
    greeting = "Wazzzzzup"
    print(greeting)
```

### Data Types
#### Variables
Create a variable: `variable_name = "variable name"`
Delete a variable: `del variable_name`

* Deleting variables in Python is not that common. Python keeps a count of how many times that variable is used or mentioned somewhere and when the reference count becomes 0, Python just throws the variable away.
